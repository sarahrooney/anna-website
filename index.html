At school they called me a new media artist, on YouTube they call me a creator, on Instagram they call me an influencer, and in the advertising world they call me a strategist.

					<p>My brand experience at Havas includes Reynolds Consumer Products, AutoZone, Ragú, Bertolli, and Kmart. In addition to my agency work, I’ve worked as a social influencer for the past five years and have worked with brands such as e.l.f. Cosmetics, Graze, and SEE Eyewear to create lifestyle content. I offer consulting and strategic guidance as services, and have helped start-ups and brands navigate their presence online. I enjoy public speaking and have been invited to speak at conferences, universities, and organizations in the US and abroad.</p>
