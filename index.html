						<p>SOCIAL MEDIA AUDIT:</p> <img src="images/speaking_hashtag.png" id="hashtag">
						<p>If social media was easy, everyone would have a kick ass social media presence. I’m here to make it easier for you. I’ll start with a thorough analysis of your social channels, evaluating everything from what’s working with your audience to the overall cohesiveness of your presence. After I assess, I’ll identify 3 main areas of opportunity so your brand can really flourish.</p>

As someone who works actively in both the influencer world as well as the agency world, I’ve developed a unique, nuanced perspective on brands can best collaborate with influencers in a way that’s rewarding for all parties. I will help identify if an influencer makes sense for your brand’s goals, and develop a strategy ranging from long-term partnerships to short-term reach-driven campaigns.</p>
